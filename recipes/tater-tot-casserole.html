    <h2>Description</h1>
    <p>
        Craving a super easy and delicious dinner that everyone at your table will devour? This Tater Tot casserole is exactly what you need! It's a truly comforting dish that comes together with just four simple ingredients. You can't beat that for a quick weeknight meal!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground Beef: Grab about 1 to 1.5 pounds of ground beef. You'll cook this until it's nice and brown and crumbly.</li>
        <li>Cream of Mushroom Soup: You'll want one standard can (around 10.5 ounces) of condensed cream of mushroom soup. This is your secret weapon for richness and creaminess!</li>
        <li>Seasonings: Just the basics here! Have some salt (maybe 1/2 to 1 teaspoon, or to taste) and black pepper (a generous pinch or two) ready to go.</li>
        <li>Tater Tots: Of course, the stars of the show! You'll need about one 32-ounce bag of frozen tater tots.</li>
        <li>Cheddar Cheese: For the best melty goodness, get about 1.5 to 2 cups of shredded Cheddar cheese. Trust us, shredding your own makes a difference!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First things first, get all your ingredients ready to go. While you’re doing that, go ahead and preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Next, grab a large skillet and heat it over medium-high. Toss in your ground beef and cook it up, stirring occasionally, until it’s all browned and crumbly – that should take about 7 to 10 minutes. Once it's cooked, stir in that condensed soup, then add your salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Now, transfer that yummy beef mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer your tater tots evenly on top, and then sprinkle generously with that delicious Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>Pop your casserole into the preheated oven and bake for about 30 to 45 minutes. You’ll know it’s ready when those tater tots are beautifully golden brown and piping hot!</li>
        <li>Finally, serve it up and enjoy every comforting bite!</li>
    </ol>
