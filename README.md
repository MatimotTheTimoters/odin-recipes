# odin-recipes

This is my first actual project I've finished in Odin Project, after trying out the Full Stack JavaScript without going over Foundations path first. The first project there was quite overwhelming, I did not know how to start. I thought I had the necessary skills for front-end programming but reality told me that my self evaluation was inaccurate. After trying out the Full Stack program in freeCodeCamp, it just didn't feel right -- what I wanted is to keep track of my projects and that's how I found myself here. This is my second attempt at making this project, the first attempt did not include a roadmap where I just followed the instructions blindly which made my commits quite messy. I also had to revisit Git commands quite a bit of times but it was all worth it, working on projects this way felt very much different and more exciting than not having a roadmap and the imaginary checkpoints that GitHub provides. With all that aside, this is my first project in Odin Project where I got some help from Gemini in paraphrasing content from the provided recipes website.
